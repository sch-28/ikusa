	visit and use our website Ikusa.site.

	<h1>Information We Collect:</h1>

	<h1>Discord Login</h1>
	<p>
		When you login to Ikusa using Discord, we collect your Discord ID, username, and avatar. We use
		this information to identify you on our website, allowing you to share your wars. Additional
		settings will be saved to our database, such as your set guild, family name and whether you have
		enabled BDO-Sync.
	</p>
	<h1>BDO-Data</h1>
	<p>
		Sharing a war will upload all its data to our database. This includes the guilds, players and
		classes. The set war name and date will also be saved. If you have the BDO-Sync enabled, the
		fetched characters, players and classes will be saved to our database.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you use the upload function of the Ikusa Logger or the migration option from the old
		website, we will temporarily save the logs on the database to process them. This data will be
		deleted after the upload is complete.
	</p>
